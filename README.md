Report/

The introduction should be read first followed by the research summary. This poses the problem we wish to tackle and expands upon our chosen data set. This should be followed by the individual reports in the appropriately numbered order. Finally, the report and conclusion give a summary of the results obtained and any conclusions that can be drawn from the data.

# Requirements
Requirements for the Python files are given within each script at the start.

# Data
Any data that we access from within our reports is found in:

Data/

The main data is the enron emails and any other data found in here are pickled files that are results from the data processing to reduce computation time on time expensive processes in the reports.

# Individual Work

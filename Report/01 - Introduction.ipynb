    "Our group was faced with the task of: **applying topic-modelling to non-trivial data in a cyber security context**. Our first challenge was to identify the data set we will perform topic modelling on. This formed most of our research time and involved looking for cybersecurity related data sets, meta data, byte-code and reports that can be modelled using topic modelling. In the documentation and code below, we will outline: the research we undertook and the reason for deciding on using the Enron spam data set, the topic modelling we perform and an analysis of the results obtained. We phrase our question surrounding this data set as: **‘Analyse the Enron spam vs normal data set to create and visualise a topic model and understand the features of spam emails.’**"
